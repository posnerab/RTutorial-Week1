# The first time you open this R script (.R) document, 
# RStudio should prompt you to install all below packages if they
# are not currently installed on your machine.

# To test if the packages installed correctly, do the following:
# 1. open the R markdown (.Rmd) file named "test.Rmd"
# 2. click Knit above and then click Knit to HTML.
# 3. if a knitted HTML document opens automatically, you're done!

# EACH TIME you open RStudio thereafter, do the following:
# 1. open this document again
# 2. press command+A to select all text
# 3. click Run to load all libraries
